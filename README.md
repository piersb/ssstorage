# README

A web (and perhaps in the future command-line) interface to Amazon s3 and other storage instances, for the purpose of getting our RPG audio logs off of my computer and freeing up some space.

I can't imagine there'll be a great number of people needing this itch scratched, but feel free to fork if so.

Some of the user/login code was originally from Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial.
